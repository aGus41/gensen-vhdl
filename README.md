VHDL project for the UC3M course 'Integrated circuits and microelectronics'. The circuit designed generates a sinusoidal signal represented in 8 bits, with its frequency being dependent on the values selected in 2 swithces in the FPGA. This signal is then displayed in the FPGA LEDs and in a DAC. Later we designed a FIR filter with cutoff frecuency of 1kHz. We used the Basys3 FPGA from Digilent.
